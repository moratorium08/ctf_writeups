# ierae CTF writeup


## Intel CET

1. Register `main` as the signal handler for segfault
2. basically, open -> read -> puts

However the second part requires a trick since we can only control two arguments
for each function call, the argument is set to 0.

I utilized `__uflow`, which is a unary-function that takes a FILE pointer, and 
reads a byte.
Since `__uflow` does IO buffering like other IO-related functions, if we call it 
with a specific fake FILE structure, we can read the content into an arbitrary
address.

## Command Recorder

The bug was `strcpy(buf, buf', n)` where buf and buf' are overlapping.
The actual implementation for strcpy on the server uses __strcpy_avx2, and therefore 
we can exploit some optimizations in the function to trigger some undefined behavior.
